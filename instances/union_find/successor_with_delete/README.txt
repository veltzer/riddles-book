Successor with delete. Given a set of N integers S={0,1,...,N−1} and a sequence of requests of the following form:

    Remove x from S
    Find the successor of x: the smallest y in S such that y≥x.

design a data type so that all operations (except construction) should take logarithmic time or better.
