Social network connectivity.
Given a social network containing n members and a log file containing m timestamps
at which times pairs of members formed friendships,
design an algorithm to determine the earliest time at which all members are connected
(i.e., every member is a friend of a friend of a friend ... of a friend).

Assume that the log file is sorted by timestamp and that friendship is an equivalence
relation. The running time of your algorithm should be m*log(⁡)n or better and use
extra space proportional to n.
