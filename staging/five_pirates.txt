Five pirates find a sack containing 100 gold coins which they want to
distribute between them.

The rules for distributing coins are as follows:

The pirates have a hierarchy of seniority between them: the most senior
pirate is #5, then #4, etc... , the most junior pirate is #1.
The most senior pirate (#5) gets to propose to the others how to distribute
the coins. Then all 5 pirates vote on his proposition.
If at least 50% accept the proposition, the coins are distributed accordingly
and they're done.
Else, pirate #5 is shot and the remaining pirates repeat the process with the
next in line (#4) making the proposal. And so it goes on...

Some facts about pirates:

- A pirate's highest priority is to stay alive.
- A pirate's second priority is to accumulate gold. A pirate stives to get as
  much gold as feasibly possible.
- Last, every pirate is blood thirsty and if it's of no consequence to him,
  he'll always vote against in the hope of a possible kill.

Suggest a proposal for pirate #5 such that he can  both guarantee staying alive
and maximize the number of gold coins he can keep.


Solution:
Pirate #5 gives one coin to pirate #3, one coin to pirate #1 and keeps the rest.

1. If there are 2 pirates:
   #2's proposal: nothing for #1, #2 keeps 100 coins.
   The vote:      #2 - for, #1 - against.
     #2 has 50% of the votes and they're done.

2. If there are 3 pirates:

   #3 knows that if he gets shot they're back to case (1) where the next in
   line - #2 - gets everything and #1 gets nothing. So he proposes to give #1 a
   single coin which will make it a better alternative for him.

   #3's proposal: 1 coin to #1, nothing for #2, #3 keeps the rest.
   The vote:      #3 - for, #2 - against, #1 - for.
     #3 has (more than) 50% of the votes and they're done.

3. If there are 4 pirates:

   Pirate #4 applies similar logic as did #3 in the previous case.

   #4's proposal: 1 coin to #2, nothing for #1 and #3, #4 keeps the rest.
   The vote:      #4 - for, #3 - against, #2 - for, #1 against.
     #4 has 50% of the votes and they're done.

With 5 pirates, applying similar logic has #1 and #3 getting a single coin
each, nothing for #2 and #4, and #5 keeps the rest.
