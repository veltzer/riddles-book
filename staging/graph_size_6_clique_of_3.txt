prove that every graph of size 6 has at least a clique of 3 or
it's reverse has a clique of 3.

Another way to phrase this riddle is this:
prove that in every group of 6 people there are either three people
that know each other or three people that don't know each other.

Solution:
Lets take a node A by random from the graph. This node has 5 potential
neighbors.

If the exit level of A is 3 or higher lets mark it's three
neighbours as B, C, D. If one of the following edges: BC, CD, BD exist
then it creats a clique of size 3 with A. If none of them exist then
B, C, D are a clique of size 3 of the reverse graph.

If the exit level of A is lower than 3 then lets mark it's three
missing neighbours as B, C, D. If any edge of BC, CD, BD is missing
then it is a missing clique of size 3 with A. If all of them as missing
then (B, C, D) is a missing clique (clique of the inverse graph).
