This riddle is invented by me after seeing the "into the night" netflix series

Lets assume:
- the circumference of the earth is 48000 km
- planes fly at 1000 km/h
- night is exactly 12 hours of the day

If you want to fly as much as possible and stay in the night would you fly east
or west and what time and distance would that be?

Solution
========

going east
==========
Lets assume we fly east then we start when night comes and then the distance beween
use and the edge of night is half the globe (24,000 km).
And then if n is the number of hours we fly:
	1000 * n + 2000 *n = 24000
	3000 * n = 24000
	n = 8
and distance is:
	n * 1000 = 8000 km which is a sixth of the circumference of the earth
	so we will make it around the globe in 6 flights or six days.

going west
==========
If we fly west it's ok since the night is always ahead of us since it's going at 48,000/24 = 2000 km/h
So the equation is:
	1000 * n + 24000 = 2000 * n
	1000 * n = 24000
	n = 24
	and the distance is 24 * 1000 = 24,000 km which means we can go around the globe in 2 flights or two days.
