A boss informs his 100 employees that the next day there's going to be a RIF
(reduction in force).
He tells them that the way he's going to do it is by standing them one behind
the other in a straight line - all facing the same direction such that each one
can see all those in front of him/her. He'll then place either a white or a
black cap on each of their heads.
Finally, each one in turn, will then have to state out loud what color cap they
have on their head. If correct - the employee keeps his/her job, otherwise -
he/she is fired.

The boss agrees to permit the employees to pre-decide the order at which they
speak.

Suggest a strategy by which the maximum number of employees can keep their job.


Solution:
99 people can be guaranteed to keep their job, 1 has a 50% chance.

Strategy:
The idea is to use binary addition modulo-2, where for example, white is
equivalent to 0 and black is equivalent to 1.

The employees speak from last in line (#1) to first in line (#100).
The last in line (#1) sums up all those in front and adds a 0 or 1
(i.e. declares white or black) as required such that the total sum is
0 modulo-2.
She thus has a 50% chance of keeping her job.

Statement:
For each employee #N from #2 to #100:
   ( sum(#1 to #N-1) + #N + sum(#N+1 to #100) ) modulo-2 = 0

Proof by induction:
1. for N=2:
   #1 called such that:
   #1 + sum(#2 to #100) ) modulo-2 = sum(#1) + #2 + sum(#3 to #100) modulo-2 = 0
   Hence this is correct for #2.
2. assume the statement is correct for #N, we show it's correct for #N+1:
   by assumption:
   0 = sum(#1 to #N-1) + #N + sum(#N+1 to #100) =
   sum(#1 to #N-1) + #N + #N+1 + sum(#N+2 to #100) =
   sum(#1 to #N) + #N+1 + sum(#N+2 to #100)
Q.E.D

And so, #1 has a 50% chance of keeping her job, while every employee from #2 to
#100 can calculate exactly what they have on their head by "adding" the colors
in front of them and those declared behind them such that the total sum remains
0 modulo-2.
