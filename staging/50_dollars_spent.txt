I have 50 dollars

	I spend 	Left
	20		30
	15		15
	9		6
	6		0

The first column sums to 50
The second column sums to 51!

How is that?

Solution
========
It doesn't matter what the second column sums up to!

Imagine that I would spend all the 50 at once then the second column would sum to 0.
Imagine that I spent the 50 one dollar at a time so the second column would sum up to:
	49+48+...+1 = 50*49/2 = 1225
