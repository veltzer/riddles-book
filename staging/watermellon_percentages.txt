A watermellon weighs 10 kg and is 99% water.
He sits in the sun and some of the water is evaoprated and now it is
only 98% water.

What is the new weight of the watermellon?

Solution
========
The watermellon weighs 10 kg and is 99% water.
This means that the non water part is 0.1 kg.
Now the watermellon is 98% water which means that the 0.1 kg
is 2% of the new weight. 2% is 1/50 of the weight which means
that the new weight is 0.1 * 50 = 5 kg.
