find the solution to the following equation:
	sqrt(x) + sqrt(x+87) = 87
solution:
1^2 = 1
2^2 = 4
3^2 = 9
4^2 = 16

creates the series 1 4 9 16
whose differences are 3 5 7 
this means that 87 is the difference tetween 43^2 and 44^4
so x=43^2

Follow up question:
	sqrt(x) + sqrt(x+87) = sqrt(87)
solution:
	x=0 is an obvious solution.
	There are no others because of the inequallity of the triangle.
	If sqrt(x) is the length a side of a right angled triangle and another side is sqrt(87).
	then the hypothenus is sqrt(x+87) (pythgoras).
	and since any sum of two sides is greater than the third it follows that:
		sqrt(x) + sqrt(x+87) > sqrt(87)
