A certain prison has 100 prisoners. The warden offers the following deal:

In a room, 100 boxes stand in a row. Scraps of paper with the number 1..100 were randomly shuffled into those boxes.

Each prisoner has a unique number from 1 to 100. Each prisoner will be allowed to enter the room one at a time, and open up to 50 boxes one at a time. He may only look in the box to see what number is there, and may not move the scraps of paper or the boxes. All boxes will be closed after a prisoner leaves the room, before the next prisoner is brought in. If any prisoner fails to open the box containing their own number, all the prisoners will be put to death. If all prisoners find their own number, then all prisoners will go free. Once the process begins, prisoners will not be allowed to communicate with each other in any fashion. Clearly if each prisoner opens 50 boxes at random, the probability that everyone will go free is (1/2)^100, which is not very good. By what strategy can the prisoners improve their chances? What is the chance? Is it good?

Solution:
The idea is that the prisoner N will open the box N. If the paper there says N he is done. If not, he will open the box whose number
he sees. He will continue to do so.

Why is this good? The relationship of box N pointing eventually to box M forms an equivalence relation on the set of boxes.
This means that if there is no set within that equivalence relation which is larger than 50 than each prisoner will find
his/her number.

Do basically we need to answer the following question: given a random distribution of the numbers 1..100
into a hundred boxes what are the chances of a circle forming whose length is greater than 50? This I have not done yet.
But this number doesn't seem that big and is certainly plausible (unlike 0.5^100).
