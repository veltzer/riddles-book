How many times do the clock hands meet in one day?

Solution:
If you though it was 24 you are mistaken.

solution 1:
the first time they meet is when the day starts (12:00).
then a little after 1.
then more after 2.
etc..
but when 11 arrives then they don't meet and only meet at the next 12:00.
So we have 11 meets for the first 12 hours (not including the next 12:00).
then we have 11 more since the next 12:00 belongs to the next day.
so 22 times in all.
