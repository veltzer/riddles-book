On a circular track there is an unknown number of balls racing at a contact speed of one
cycle per second. Some of them clockwise and some counter clockwise.
When two balls collide they immediately change direction and continue at the same speed.
After ten seconds there were 860 collisions.
How many balls are there?

Solution
First lets get ridd of the direction change on collision.
This is because the balls are identical so we can think of each collision as just the balls
passing each other by. The whole experiment does not change nor the number of "passing by"
or "collisions".

Next lets understand that the number of collisions per second is constant because if the
balls dont change direction then they do the *exact same thing* every second.

This means that there are 86 "pass by" events per second.

Now if there are X balls going clockwise and Y balls going counter clock wise then
there are X*Y*2 events. so X*Y=43 in our case. Since 43 is prime then the only
option is 1 and 43. Which means that in total we have 44 balls.

In addition we also know that there is one ball going in one direction (we don't know which)
and 43 balls going in the opposite direction.
