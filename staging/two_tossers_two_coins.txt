Two people are placed in a game. The game will be made up of turns.
At each turn each of them will toss a fair coin. Each will see only
the result of his coin and not the result of his partner. Each will
try to guess the result of the toss of it's partner. Each round in
which *at least* one of them guessed correctly as to the toss result
of his partner is a round in which they win. Each round in which
they both failed to guess what their partner tossed will count as a
loss.
They can plan a strategy to follow before the experiment begins.
Once the experiment begins they cannot talk any more.

The question: what strategy should they adopt in order to maximize
the number of rounds in which they will win?

Solution
========
This riddle seems, at first glance, to be counter intuitive and
it looks like they cannot do better than 75% (if they both guess
there is only a 25% chance that they will both be wrong). You
can actually get to 100%.

Here is goes:
One of them should guess the result of his own coin toss while
the other should guess the inverse of the result of his own coin toss.

Why does it work? In every round either they both have the same result
or different results for the tosses. If they have the same result then
the one guessing his result will be correct. If they have different
results then the one guessing the inverse of his own toss will be
corret.

Overall, they will be correct in all rounds.
