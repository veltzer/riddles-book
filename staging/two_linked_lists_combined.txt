You are given two singly linked lists. You are told that at some point they combine this way:

		   This is the element to find
				 |
	o -> o -> o -> o -> o -> o -> o -> NULL
				/
                     o -> o -> o 

You need to find the first element that is common to both lists.

You need to do with with linear running time and O(1) of memory.

Solution:
- first, find the length of the lists (l1, l2)
- find the longest one.
- p1 = pointer to the start of the short list
- p2 = pointer to the long list at offset abs(l1-l2)
- compare the elements, if the are the same you are done
- if they are not the same advance both pointers:
	p1 = p1->next
	p2 = p2->next
thats it.
