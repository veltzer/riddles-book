This is a queue of riddles to be written down properly
=======================================================
- google interview questions:
	and the holidays exercise.
		this is a dynamic programming example.
	the snake exercise
	the pirates riddle about dividing money.
		http://www.mathsisfun.com/puzzles/5-pirates-solution.html
	maybe even write the two design exercises?

- write eli shalom's riddle about giving out the largest number and index in equal probability.

- why is (n k) (n over k) always a whole number?
	One way to explain this is to explain what (n k) means and therefore
	deduce that it's whole. But what about a purely mathematical explanation
	of why n! is divisible by k!(n-k)! ?

Rorig=40000/2*PI

Rnew=(40000+0.01)/2*PI=Rorig+10m/2*PI=Rorig+10/6.28=Rorig+1.6m

This result is quite surprising. Intuition says that 10m is nothing and should
be very close to the surface. It turns out that the addition in height is
independant of the circumfence of the thing you are adding to! 10m will buy you
1.6 meters on the sun as well...:)
