## build

![build](https://github.com/veltzer/riddles-book/workflows/build/badge.svg)

The idea is to create a collection of many riddles for your enjoyment.

Tools include: make, pdflatex, lacheck, latex, dvips, ps2pdf, latex2html, perl, sketch, git,
        flexpaper, pdf2swf, qpdf, pdfinfo, pdftex, pdftohtml, luatex, xetex and possibly more.

If you want to compile this package then:
* install all required packages.
        Ubuntu users you are in luck: just run "scripts/ubuntu_install.sh"...
* make
All the output is in the "out" folder.
